**New Flipper Zero custom firmware coming soon!!**

This project is all about unlocking the full potential of the Flipper Zero—pushing boundaries, bending rules, and exploring unorthodox ways to use hardware that *should* technically work (but maybe wasn’t meant to). If you like hacking, tweaking, and geeking out over microcontroller magic, you’re in the right place.

## 🔧 What’s the Goal?

To create a firmware that:
- Explores underutilized or undocumented hardware features
- Enables creative, experimental, and sometimes chaotic functionality
- Breaks conventional use cases in favor of clever hacks
- Turns the Flipper Zero into a playground for firmware innovation

## 🧪 What to Expect

This repo will evolve as modules and features get built. Expect:
- Custom protocols and payloads
- UI tweaks and hidden menus
- Experimental hardware integrations
- Possibly unstable but always interesting builds

## 🚧 Status

Currently in active development. Files will be committed as they’re completed. Stay tuned for updates and sneak peeks.

## 📡 Contributions & Feedback
